abstract = { Transition path sampling techniques allow molecular dynamics simulations of complex systems to focus on rare dynamical events, providing insight into mechanisms and the ability to calculate rates inaccessible by ordinary dynamics simulations. While path sampling algorithms are conceptually as simple as importance sampling Monte Carlo, the technical complexity of their implementation has kept these techniques out of reach of the broad community. Here, we introduce an easy-to-use Python framework called OpenPathSampling (OPS) that facilitates path sampling for (bio)molecular systems with minimal effort and yet is still extensible. Interfaces to OpenMM and an internal dynamics engine for simple models are provided in the initial release, but new molecular simulation packages can easily be added. Multiple ready-to-use transition path sampling methodologies are implemented, including standard transition path sampling (TPS) between reactant and product states and transition interface sampling (TIS) and its replica exchange variant (RETIS), as well as recent multistate and multiset extensions of transition interface sampling (MSTIS, MISTIS). In addition, tools are provided to facilitate the implementation of new path sampling schemes built on basic path sampling components. In this paper, we give an overview of the design of this framework and illustrate the simplicity of applying the available path sampling algorithms to a variety of benchmark problems. }

abstract = { The OpenPathSampling (OPS) package provides an easy-to-use framework to apply transition path sampling methodologies to complex molecular systems with a minimum of effort. Yet, the extensibility of OPS allows for the exploration of new path sampling algorithms by building on a variety of basic operations. In a companion paper [Swenson et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2018, 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00626] we introduced the basic concepts and the structure of the OPS package, and how it can be employed to perform standard transition path sampling and (replica exchange) transition interface sampling. In this paper, we elaborate on two theoretical developments that went into the design of OPS. The first development relates to the construction of path ensembles, the what is being sampled. We introduce a novel set-based notation for the path ensemble, which provides an alternative paradigm for constructing path ensembles and allows building arbitrarily complex path ensembles from fundamental ones. The second fundamental development is the structure for the customization of Monte Carlo procedures; how path ensembles are being sampled. We describe in detail the OPS objects that implement this approach to customization, the MoveScheme and the PathMover, and provide tools to create and manipulate these objects. We illustrate both the path ensemble building and sampling scheme customization with several examples. OPS thus facilitates both standard path sampling application in complex systems as well as the development of new path sampling methodology, beyond the default. }

Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 μs and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

abstract = "Topologically knotted proteins are tantalizing examples of how polypeptide chains can explore complex free energy landscapes to efficiently attain defined knotted conformations. The evolution trails of protein knots, however, remain elusive. We used circular permutation to change an evolutionally conserved topologically knotted SPOUT RNA methyltransferase into an unknotted form. The unknotted variant adopted the same three-dimensional structure and oligomeric state as its knotted parent, but its folding stability was markedly reduced with accelerated folding kinetics and its ligand binding was abrogated. Our findings support the hypothesis that the universally conserved knotted topology of the SPOUT superfamily evolved from unknotted forms through circular permutation under selection pressure for folding robustness and, more importantly, for functional requirements associated with the knotted structural element."

abstract = "Haloacid dehalogenases catalyse the removal of halides from organic haloacids and are of interest for bioremediation and for their potential use in the synthesis of industrial chemicals. We present the crystal structure of the homodimer DehI from Pseudomonas putida strain PP3, the first structure of a group I α-haloacid dehalogenase that can process both l- and d-substrates. The structure shows that the DehI monomer consists of two domains of ∼130 amino acids that have ∼16% sequence identity yet adopt virtually identical and unique folds that form a pseudo-dimer. Analysis of the active site reveals the likely binding mode of both l- and d-substrates with respect to key catalytic residues. Asp189 is predicted to activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack of the substrate chiral centre resulting in an inversion of configuration of either l- or d-substrates in contrast to d-only enzymes. These details will assist with future bioengineering of dehalogenases."

abstract = "A growing number of proteins have been identified as knotted in their native structures, with such entangled topological features being expected to play stabilizing roles maintaining both the global fold and the nature of proteins. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the stabilizing effect is ambiguous. Here, we combine unbiased and mechanical atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how a protein is stabilized by an inherent knot by directly comparing chemical, thermal, and mechanical denaturing properties of two proteins having the same sequence and secondary structures but differing in the presence or absence of an inherent knot. One protein is YbeA from Escherichia coli, containing a deep trefoil knot within the sequence, and the other is the modified protein with the knot of YbeA being removed. Under certain chemical denaturing conditions, the unknotted protein fully unfolds whereas the knotted protein does not, suggesting a higher intrinsic stability for the protein having a knot. Both proteins unfold under enhanced thermal fluctuations but at different rates and with distinct pathways. Opening the hydrophobic core via separation between two α-helices is identified as a crucial step initiating the protein unfolding, which, however, is restrained for the knotted protein by topological and geometrical frustrations. Energy barriers for denaturing the protein are reduced by removing the knot, as evidenced by mechanical unfolding simulations. Finally, yet importantly, no obvious change in size or location of the knot was observed during denaturing processes, indicating that YbeA may remain knotted for a relatively long time during and after denaturation."

This peculiar mechanism, which only requires a few kBT, is not only interesting from an aesthetic point of view but may also play a role in future technological applications such as nanopore sequencing once strand sizes exceed 100,000 base pairs.We propose a mechanism in which two molecular knots pass through each other and swap positions along a polymer strand. Associated free energy barriers in our simulations only amount to a few kBT, which may enable the interchange of knots on a single DNA strand.},

abstract="Most proteins need to avoid the complex topologies when folding into the native structures, but some proteins with nontrivial topologies have been found in nature. Here we used protein unfolding simulations under high temperature and all-atom G{\={o}}-model to investigate the folding mechanisms for two trefoil knot proteins. Results show that, the contacts in $\beta$-sheet are important to the formation of knot protein, and if these contacts disappeared, the knot protein would be easy to untie. In the G{\={o}}-model simulations, the folding processes of the two knot proteins are similar. The compact structures of the two knot proteins with the native contacts in $\beta$-sheet are formed in transition state, and the intermediate state has loose C-terminal. This model also reveals the detailed folding mechanisms for the two proteins.",
